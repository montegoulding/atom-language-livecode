# LiveCode Language package for Atom

![LiveCode Community Logo](http://livecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/livecode-logo.png)

This is a language package for Atom that provides support for editing
[LiveCode](http://livecode.com/) source code.

LiveCode is an open source platform provides a way to build applications for
mobile, desktop and server platforms. The visual workflow allows the user to
develop apps "live", using a powerful and uniquely-accessible language syntax.

The LiveCode server syntax and revIgniter snippets were converted from the
TextMate bundles available from the [revIgniter](http://revigniter.com/)
website.

## Supported languages

Currently, this package supports editing:

* LiveCode Builder source code in `.lcb` files
* LiveCode server source code in `.lc` and `.irev` files
* LiveCode Script source code in `.livecodescript` files, where the shebang line
contains `livecode` or the first line contains an Emacs mode comment
`# -*- mode:livecodescript -*-`

The package provides syntax highlighting, highlighting and indentation support
for all the supported languages.

It also provides snippets to enhance LiveCode server script and revIgniter
script development.

For LiveCode Script there are quite a number of autocomplete snippets generated
from the LiveCode documentation.

## Installation

Install the `language-livecode` package from the "Install Packages and Themes"
view in Atom's "Settings" window.

You may also wish to install the [revIgniter theme](https://atom.io/themes/revigniter-syntax)
for Atom.

## Script Error Checking

This package provides a linter for LiveCode Script, LiveCode Server and LiveCode
Builder to highlight and describe script compilation errors on the fly.

![Linter In Action](http://ecove.on-rev.com/linter.gif)

Dependencies:

 * The [linter package](https://atom.io/packages/linter) needs to be installed
 * LiveCode 7.1+ Server engine for the platform it is being run on must be
 accessible

The default setting assumes you have installed the LiveCode Server engine somewhere
on the current `$PATH` with the name `livecode-server`. However, you can enter any
path or name you choose via the package settings.

For LiveCode Server the linter will only check for errors within the scope of
the file being edited. If for example a variable re-declarition error is caused
by the inclusion of another file that error won't be detected.

The linter supports an optional explicit variables mode which can be turned on
via the package settings.

### LiveCode Builder Linting

Linting of LiveCode Builder files should be considered experimental. This is
particularly the case for projects that have complex interdependencies between
files.

In order to lint LiveCode Builder files ensure the following:

 * lc-compile can be found at the location specified in settings
 * You have appropriately set the module paths to a directory with the standard
`*.lci` files provided by LiveCode. You may add further paths delimited by `;`

The default settings assume you have a clone of the LiveCode repo in
your home directory named livecode and you have built a debug build.

In the process of linting the LiveCode Builder file a `*.lci` file is created in
a directory named `.lci` next to the file being edited. In the case of files
that have dependencies you may receive a dependency error if you edit a
file with the dependency before those it depends on because it won't be able to
fine the appropriate `*.lci` file in the `.lci` directory.
